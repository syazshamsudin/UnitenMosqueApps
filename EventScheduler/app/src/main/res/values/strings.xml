    <string name="aboutcontext1">UNITEN Mosque Apps is an application designed to help improve daily
        activity. The expansion and evolution of smart phones technologies have made society more
        dependent upon mobile application development than ever. Up until today, there is no
        application that match the purpose of this project. Thus, it is my intention to propose this
        kind of project, which to help modernize the current system.</string>
    <string name="aboutcontext2">Most of the people who often came to the UNITEN mosque are having a
        hard time to gather information regarding the events.  Those people have to go to the mosque
        to see the upcoming events at the notice board and this kind of thing would be a waste of
        time. Sometimes, people tend to forget about the event that want to join. Thus, this
        application will help to notify and remind them.</string>
